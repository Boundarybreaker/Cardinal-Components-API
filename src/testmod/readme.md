This test mod adds a new component type called Vita. Two entities can hold it: Vita Zombies and Players.
Players do not naturally have vita, vita zombies are the only source. Hitting a vita holder with a
vita stick will transfer some of it to the stick. Subsequently right clicking the stick will transfer
the collected vita to the player.
